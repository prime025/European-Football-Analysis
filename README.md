# European Football Analysis

### Requirements:

The notebook is run using Python 3. The code has been heavily tested using Python 3.6.9, but anything above 3.5 should be a safe bet.
> **Note:** You may need to use `python3` before your commands to ensure you use the correct Python path. e.g. `python3 --version`

```bash
python --version

-- or --

python3 --version
```

Please ensure you have the SQLite database downloaded in your working directory before running the code.

### Setup and Packages:

It's recommended, although not required, to create a virtual environment before installation.

**Using PyPi (pip):**

On your terminal, navigate to the root directory (the directory which has the manage.py file in it). Then run the following:

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

-- or, if your pip defaults to python3 --

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Recommended View:

We recommend that you view the notebook on your local machine, or on Jupyter's [NBviewer][nb-viewer]. 

**Warning: If you view the notebook directly on Github, some of the interactive map visualizations by the folium library may not render, due to a bug on Github. This issue can be solved by viewing the notebook on NBviewer or on your local machine.**
